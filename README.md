# Cinema Management System

This is a system designed and implemented in object-oriented method. This system aims to assist the administrator to arrange movies and screenings as well as teller to sell tickets in a simple procedure.

At the start of application running, the system requires the user to act as an administrator or a teller. The selection will lead user to either administrator panel or teller panel. Within the administrator panel, the user can operate below actions: "Add Movie", "Add Screening", "Cancel Screening", "Update Screening", "Cancel Selected". Within the teller panel, the user can operate below actions: "Sell Tickets", "Cancel Selected". Any of the above actions is connected with the back-end of the system so alerting dialogs will appear while action executed unproperly.
